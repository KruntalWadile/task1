# 🧠 Autocorrect Keyboard with Next Word Prediction

## 📌 Project Description
This project implements an **autocorrect keyboard system** that predicts the **next word** in a sentence by analyzing the contextual information from previously typed words. The system aims to improve typing speed, reduce spelling errors, and enhance overall user experience.

The project uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques such as **N-grams** and **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN/LSTM)** to learn language patterns and generate accurate word predictions.

## 🧩 Methodology

### 1. N-Gram Model
- Predicts the next word based on the previous *n-1* words  
- Simple and fast  
- Limited contextual understanding  

### 2. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN / LSTM)
- Learns long-term dependencies in text  
- More accurate predictions  
- Suitable for real-world applications
